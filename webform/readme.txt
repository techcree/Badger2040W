This demoscript still needs some tweaking. in principle, however, it is already possible to start the code that provides the web server and thus also the web form. it can then be reached under the assigned ip. There is an input field (form) available where any text can be entered. after the transfer (enter) it will be shown directly on the Bagder2040W in the display. the idea is then to stop the script on the badger2040w and restart the web server.

start the process from the c_webserver.py file!
You also need to moodify your secret.py file with your current WLAN SSID and Password Informations.
